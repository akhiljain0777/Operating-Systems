There will be a class every Monday even if no assignment is due. We will discuss topics related to the assignments given as well as topics that want you to know but may not be able to cover in the assignments given the time constraints. Attendance in each lab is mandatory and will count towards your grades.
Discussion on the assignments to better understand the topics/tools etc. is welcome. However, every line of code must be your own. Any copy detected will result in severe penalty to both parties, no excuses. So protect your code and do not share it with friends.
